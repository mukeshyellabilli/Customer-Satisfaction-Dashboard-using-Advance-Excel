## Project Overview
Customer satisfaction is a key metric for understanding how well a business meets customer expectations. This project aims to create a **Customer Satisfaction Dashboard** that displays key metrics and trends from customer feedback data. The dashboard uses advanced Excel techniques such as pivot tables, data validation, conditional formatting, and visualizations to make the data easy to interpret and actionable.

## Data Source
The dataset typically includes customer feedback or survey data, with columns such as:
- **Customer ID**
- **Customer Name**
- **Feedback Date**
- **Satisfaction Score (1-5 or 1-10 scale)**
- **Category of Feedback (e.g., Product, Service, Delivery)**
- **Customer Comments**
- **Customer Location**
  
Data may be gathered from customer satisfaction surveys, online reviews, or customer service interactions.

## Dashboard Features
The dashboard includes the following features:
- **Overall Satisfaction Score**: Displays the average satisfaction score for all customers.
- **Satisfaction by Category**: Shows satisfaction scores segmented by feedback categories like Product, Service, or Delivery.
- **Trend Analysis**: Displays satisfaction trends over time (e.g., monthly or quarterly satisfaction scores).
- **Top Positive/Negative Feedback**: Highlights customer comments that reflect the highest and lowest satisfaction scores.
- **Satisfaction by Location**: Breaks down customer satisfaction by geographic location, providing regional insights.
- **Filter Options**: Users can filter data based on time periods, categories, or regions to gain more detailed insights.

## Key Excel Functions Used
To create the Customer Satisfaction Dashboard, the following advanced Excel functionalities were employed:

1. **Pivot Tables**:
   - Used to summarize and group data, such as calculating the average satisfaction score by category, month, or location.

2. **Data Validation**:
   - Enables drop-down menus for selecting specific categories, time ranges, or regions for analysis.

3. **Conditional Formatting**:
   - Highlights cells based on satisfaction score ranges (e.g., low scores in red, high scores in green) to make it easier to identify areas of concern or success.

4. **VLOOKUP / INDEX-MATCH**:
   - Utilized for looking up customer details or comments based on feedback scores or other criteria.

5. **Charts and Graphs**:
   - Line charts for trend analysis of satisfaction scores over time.
   - Bar charts and pie charts for satisfaction breakdown by category or region.
   - Heat maps to visualize satisfaction levels across different regions or customer segments.

6. **Slicers**:
   - Added to pivot tables to allow dynamic filtering and exploration of data, making the dashboard interactive.

## Steps to Build the Dashboard
1. **Data Import and Cleaning**:
   - Import customer survey data into Excel.
   - Clean the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats.

2. **Creating Pivot Tables and Charts**:
   - Build pivot tables to summarize satisfaction scores by various dimensions (time, category, region).
   - Create dynamic charts to visualize trends, averages, and distributions of customer feedback.

3. **Adding Interactivity with Slicers**:
   - Implement slicers to allow users to filter data by time period, category, or region.

4. **Applying Conditional Formatting**:
   - Use conditional formatting to highlight areas of concern (e.g., low satisfaction scores) and success (e.g., high scores).

5. **Design and Layout**:
   - Organize the dashboard layout for ease of use. Place key metrics at the top, followed by trends and detailed breakdowns.
   - Ensure that the dashboard is visually appealing and easy to navigate by adding titles, legends, and clear labels.

## Conclusion
The **Customer Satisfaction Dashboard** created in this project provides a powerful tool for businesses to monitor and analyze customer satisfaction trends. By leveraging advanced Excel functionalities, this dashboard offers a clear overview of key satisfaction metrics, enabling businesses to take data-driven actions to improve customer experience.
